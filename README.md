# TimeFliq

Waits 50 minutes while you doing something and then locks screen and blocks any input up to 10 minutes. Great plan to make tea!

- Add once 5 minutes to work, when necessary

- With `Ctrl+Alt+Del` you can remove block input

- Select `Cranch mode`, when you want real cranch without silly interruptions

Only Windows currently supported.
